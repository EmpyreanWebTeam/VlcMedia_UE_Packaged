## üß† Setup Guide

This setup follows [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNNzUf3zNjM&t=2s) from Timo Helmers for Blueprint-based media playback using streaming URLs.

### 1. Included Blueprint: `BP_TV`

Drag the `BP_TV` Blueprint into your level. It auto-plays video on BeginPlay using an index from a predefined Media Source array.

#### üîß To customize:
- Open `BP_TV`
- Replace the default entries in the `ChannelList` array with your own `Stream Media Source` assets.
- Adjust the `ChannelIndex` integer variable to select which one auto-plays.

### 2. Blueprint Logic

The following Blueprint handles media loading and playback:

## üìå Notes

- If playback fails, check that:
- Your `.m3u8` or stream URL is public and working
- VLC is installed and supported (used under-the-hood)
- Media Source is properly assigned

- StreamMediaSources used in Blueprints must be stored in the main `Content/` folder (not inside the plugin) unless manually linked.

## üß™ Example Streams (For Testing)

Use any of these publicly accessible streams:
- [NASA TV](https://nasatv-lh.akamaihd.net/i/NASA_101@319270/master.m3u8)
- [DW English](https://dwstream4-lh.akamaihd.net/i/dwstream4_live@123456/master.m3u8)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Some streams may block cross-origin requests. Use trusted sources for production.
